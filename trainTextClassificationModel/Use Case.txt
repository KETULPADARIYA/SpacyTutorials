Text Classification is the process categorizing texts into different groups.
 SpaCy makes custom text classification structured and convenient through
 the textcat component.



# Introduction

# Let’s looks at a typical use case for Text Classification.

I’m sure each of us would have filled in a feedback after buying za book from amazon or ordering food from Swiggy.
These reviews help them to analyze the problems and improve the service. But let’s take a peek into this process. 
There are millions of reviews filled out by customers, is it possible to manually go through each of them and see 
if it’s an appreciation or a negative review?

Of course, No! The first step would be to classify all the reviews into positive and negative categories.
Then, you can easily analyze how many people were not satisfied and why. 
This process of categorizing texts into different groups/labels is called Text Classification.

Text Classification can be performed in different ways. Here, we’ll use the spaCy package to classify texts.
spaCy is has become a very popular library for NLP and provides state-of-the-art components. For practical cases,
it is mostly preferred to use a trained Custom model for classification. Let me first introduce to you what is a
custom model and why we need it in the next section.



What is a custom Text Classifier model?

Let’s say you have a bunch of movie reviews/customer reviews. You wish to classify each review as positive or negative.
If you use the default categorizer of spaCy, the result is not likely to be great. Instead, what if you collect labeled
data set of movie/customer reviews and train your model on that?

The results will be far better and accurate! You can do this by training a custom text classifier. You first train it on
 relevant labeled datasets and made ready for our use in similar context. It’s very helpful especially in cases where
 the amount of data is huge.

In the next sections, I’ll guide you step-by-step on how to train your text classification model in spaCy.
